Introduction to **Haskell** and some computer science practices for Theory of Automata and Formal Languages.

**Haskell** is a functional programming language which has some of the next features:

1. *Statically typed*: every expression in Haskell has a type which is determined at compile time. 
2. *Purely functional*: every function in Haskell is a function in the mathematical sense. 
3. *Type inference*: types will be inferred by unifying every type bidirectionally. 
4. *Concurrent*: due to its explicit handle of events, Haskell lends itslef well to concurrent programming. 
5. *Lazy*: functions don't evaluate their arguments.
